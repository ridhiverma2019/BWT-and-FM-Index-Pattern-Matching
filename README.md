# BWT-and-FM-Index-Pattern-Matching

This project implements the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and the FM-index to perform exact pattern matching in genome sequences.

## Features
- Performs BWT on a given sequence.
- Constructs the FM-index (C-array and occurrence table).
- Finds exact pattern matches in genome sequences.

## Installation
Clone this repository and run the `bwt_pattern_matching.py` script.

## Usage
- Place your genome sequences in a text file (e.g., `corona.txt`).
- Run the script and provide the desired pattern for search.

Example:
```bash
python bwt_pattern_matching.py
